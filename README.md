# BubbaFlip Discord bot
###### This does not include the entire bot source, just commands that people could find useful
**I might share the entire bot at some point but ill give a simple setup**

Python 3.11+ is **required**, atleast thats the only thing these were tested on

Install the following libraries with **pip**:
- Requests
- Discord (**pip install py-cord** or **pip install -U discord.py**)

Once everything is installed, set up your Discord bot for slash commands as usual and paste the commands into your code
